# Aergia
Aergia is the Greek Goddess of laziness. And she has blessed you with the ability to do some really lazy web design work, while still creating a great looking website.

#In Development
Aergia is still in development, and will be coming very soon. There are files included that have been created specifically for testing purposes. Feel free to look at them to see the progress made and how to use the framework.
